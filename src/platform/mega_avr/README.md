This file contains the platform code for common, atmega328p and atmega2560 currently.

Some differences between the two AVR microcontrollers:

atmega 328p: It has 32KB of Flash memory, 1KB of SRAM, and 1KB of EEPROM. It provides 23 general-purpose I/O pins.
atmega 2560: It has 256KB of Flash memory, 8KB of SRAM, and 4KB of EEPROM. It provides 86 general-purpose I/O pins. Has advanced PWM channels.
